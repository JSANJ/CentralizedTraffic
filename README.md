# CentralizedTraffic

Conditions: 
  1. Max acceleration/deceleration are defined.
  2. Max speed is defined.
  3. Runway lengths are equal.
  4. 4 sides in intersection.
  5. 4 lanes (2 each direction) on each side.
  6. Constant speed in intersection (for simplifaction).
  
Assumptions:  
  1. (Currently) Only going straight.
  2. Acceleration/deceleration is constant and discontinuous.
  
To be implemented:
  1. Continuous (linear) acceleration/deceleration.
  2. Left/Right/U-turns.
  3. Continuous (non-linear) acceleration/deceleration.
